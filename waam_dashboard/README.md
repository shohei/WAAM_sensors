Arduino and Raspberry Pi are connected via a USB cable.

The expected format is `val1,val2,...`: the values (both integer and float accepted) are separated by commas.

It currently shows the dummy date from Arduino, as the wiring of the thermocoupld was somehow messed up.

BUG: After receiving about 50(?) data, the plotting stops. The cause needs to be identified.
